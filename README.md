These are my files currently on my progress for our interactive UI for apolo software.

Currently, the app.js isn't working perfectly and I am rewritting the js.react code to make it work on my machine.
If you notice anything that needs to be changed or fixed go ahead and help as I troubleshoot! Thank you!


[To initiate the App.js file in my terminal I've been running:]

> npx create-react-app live-docker-generator

> cd live-docker-generator

> npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled yaml

> replacing the app.js file in live-docker with our written app.js file

> npm start
